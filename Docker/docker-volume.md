    TOPIC:          Docker Volume

## DOCKER VOLUME:

- In Docker, a volume is a persistent storage location that is separate from the default Union File System and exists outside of the container's lifecycle.

- Volumes are useful for storing data that is generated by and used by Docker containers. They can be shared and reused among containers.

- You can use volumes to store data that you want to persist even after the container is stopped or removed.

- You can also use volumes to share data between containers.

## DOCKER VOLUME COMMANDS:

docker volume create: Create a new volume

docker volume ls: List all volumes

docker volume inspect: Inspect a volume

docker volume rm: Remove one or more volumes

docker volume prune: Remove all unused volumes

For an Example:

    # Create a new volume called "my_volume"
    $ docker volume create my_volume

    # List all volumes

    $ docker volume ls
    DRIVER               VOLUME NAME
    local                my_volume

    # Inspect the "my_volume" volume
    $ docker volume inspect my_volume
    [
        {
            "CreatedAt": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "Driver": "local",
            "Labels": {},
            "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/my_volume/_data",
            "Name": "my_volume",
            "Options": {},
            "Scope": "local"
        }
    ]

    # Remove the "my_volume" volume
    $ docker volume rm my_volume

    # Remove all unused volumes
    $ docker volume prune

# Docker --volume:

- The --volume flag is used to bind mount a volume from the host machine into the container.
- This allows you to share data between the container and the host, and persist data even after the container is stopped or removed.

Syntax:

    docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...] --volume SOURCE:DESTINATION

Example:

    docker run --name mycontainer -v /host/folder:/container/folder myimage

This command will bind mount the folder /host/folder from the host machine into the container at the path /container/folder.

# Docker --mount:

- The --mount flag is used to specify a mount point for a volume, bind mount, or tmpfs mount in the container. It allows you to specify additional options for the mount, such as read-only or shared.

Syntax:

    docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...] --mount type=TYPE,source=SOURCE,destination=DESTINATION[,readonly]

Example:

    docker run --name mycontainer -m type=bind,source=/host/folder,destination=/container/folder,readonly myimage

This command will bind mount the folder /host/folder from the host machine into the container at the path /container/folder, and set the mount as read-only.

# Docker --TMPFS:

- The --TMPFS flag is used to create a temporary filesystem (tmpfs) in the container.
- This is a volatile filesystem that is stored in memory and is not persisted after the container is stopped or removed.
- It is useful for storing temporary data that does not need to be persisted.

Syntax:

    docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...] --tmpfs DESTINATION[:OPTIONS]

Example:

    docker run --name mycontainer --tmpfs /container/tmp:rw,size=64M myimage

This command will create a tmpfs mount at the path /container/tmp in the container, with read-write permissions and a size of 64MB.
