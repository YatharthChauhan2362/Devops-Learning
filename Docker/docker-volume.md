## DOCKER VOLUME

- In Docker, a volume is a persistent storage location that is separate from the default Union File System and exists outside of the container's lifecycle.

- Volumes are useful for storing data that is generated by and used by Docker containers. They can be shared and reused among containers.

- You can use volumes to store data that you want to persist even after the container is stopped or removed.

- You can also use volumes to share data between containers.

## DOCKER VOLUME COMMANDS:

docker volume create: Create a new volume

docker volume ls: List all volumes

docker volume inspect: Inspect a volume

docker volume rm: Remove one or more volumes

docker volume prune: Remove all unused volumes

For an Example:

    # Create a new volume called "my_volume"
    $ docker volume create my_volume

    # List all volumes

    $ docker volume ls
    DRIVER               VOLUME NAME
    local                my_volume

    # Inspect the "my_volume" volume
    $ docker volume inspect my_volume
    [
        {
            "CreatedAt": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "Driver": "local",
            "Labels": {},
            "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/my_volume/_data",
            "Name": "my_volume",
            "Options": {},
            "Scope": "local"
        }
    ]

    # Remove the "my_volume" volume
    $ docker volume rm my_volume

    # Remove all unused volumes
    $ docker volume prune
