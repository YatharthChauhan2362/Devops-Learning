## ELK STACK:

- ELK is a acronym for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. These three open-source tools are used together to create a complete log management solution.

1. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine that stores data in the form of documents. It is used to index, search, and analyze data.

2. Logstash is a data processing pipeline that ingests data from a variety of sources, transforms it, and then sends it to Elasticsearch.

3. Kibana is a visualization tool that allows you to see and analyze the data stored in Elasticsearch. It provides a graphical interface for creating and editing dashboard views of data stored in Elasticsearch.

- ELK is often used for log analysis, security analysis, and business intelligence.

## ELK Features:

- Scalability:

Elasticsearch is designed to scale horizontally across multiple machines.

- Real-time search:

Elasticsearch is capable of searching through large volumes of data very quickly, making it suitable for real-time search scenarios.

- Full-text search:

Elasticsearch supports full-text search, which means it can search through the text of documents as well as search for specific words or phrases.

- Advanced analytics:

Kibana provides a wide range of visualization options, allowing users to create a variety of charts, tables, and maps to help understand and analyze data.

- Data transformation:

Logstash can transform data as it is ingested, allowing users to extract specific fields, rename fields, and perform basic calculations on data.

- Plugins:

Both Elasticsearch and Logstash have a rich ecosystem of plugins that allow users to extend their functionality. Kibana also has a number of plugins that provide additional visualization options.
