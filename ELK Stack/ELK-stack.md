## ELK STACK:

- ELK is a acronym for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. These three open-source tools are used together to create a complete log management solution.

1. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine that stores data in the form of documents. It is used to index, search, and analyze data.

2. Logstash is a data processing pipeline that ingests data from a variety of sources, transforms it, and then sends it to Elasticsearch.

3. Kibana is a visualization tool that allows you to see and analyze the data stored in Elasticsearch. It provides a graphical interface for creating and editing dashboard views of data stored in Elasticsearch.

- ELK is often used for log analysis, security analysis, and business intelligence.
